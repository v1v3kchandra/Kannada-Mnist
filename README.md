## Understanding the Data
- The numericals in kannada is as follows
!["Numericals"](/demo/kannada_digits.png)
## Directory Structure
- data
  -contains the train.csv ,val.csv and test.csv file
- model
  -contains the pretrained model.
- src
  -contains train_model.py- to train the model and main.py- to open gui to draw kannada digits and predict.
- image dump
  -every image drawn is stored here( future use- could be used as dataset for training)
